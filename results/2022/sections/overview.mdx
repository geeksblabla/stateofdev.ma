# 1.Overview

The third annual survey on Software Developers in Morocco provides invaluable insights into the community and their professional paths. This year's results are particularly interesting as we can draw trends from previous years. Here are some selected takeaways:

- There was a 67% increase in the number of respondents compared to last year, with a 3% increase in female participation.
- JavaScript remains the most popular language, while Python is the fastest growing.
- A third of the respondents use AI tools in their work on a daily basis, and over 50% of companies now operate remotely as the new normal.

### A word about methodology

At our core, we value anonymity and as such, all collected data from the survey is anonymized. Raw results and the website code are also available under the BY-NC-SA 2.0 license on the [DevC-Casa GitHub organization](https://github.com/DevC-Casa/stateofdev.ma).

Please note that not all fields in the survey were mandatory, which may result in some results and graphics not reflecting the total number of respondents for every question.

We extend our heartfelt thanks to all our contributors and those who helped share the survey, and we eagerly await your feedback and for you to share the results with your network.

Finally, we express our gratitude to [Kawtar CHOUBARI](https://www.linkedin.com/in/choubari/) for creating an amazing [promotion video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRi8IT5coHs) for the survey.
