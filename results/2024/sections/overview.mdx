# Overview

The fifth annual survey on Software Developers in Morocco offers valuable insights into the community and their professional paths. We continue to track the impact of AI on Moroccan software developers and how they are adjusting to this evolving trend.

This year's results are particularly interesting as we can draw trends from previous years. Here are some selected takeaways:

- Developers are actively using AI tools in their day-to-day workflow

- JavaScript is still the most popular language amongst developers, while Golang and Rust are on top of the wanted list.

- Around 40% of respondents do not write tests for their code.

- Training opportunities, the industry and the impact of one's work are not as decisive as the salary and the tech stack when choosing a job.

## A word about methodology

At our core, we value anonymity and as such, all collected data from the survey is anonymized. Raw results and the website code are also available under the BY-NC-SA 2.0 license on the [GeeksBlaBla GitHub organization](https://github.com/geeksblabla/stateofdev.ma).

Please note that not all fields in the survey were mandatory, which may result in some results and graphics not reflecting the total number of respondents for every question.

We extend our heartfelt thanks to all our contributors and those who helped share the survey, and we eagerly await your feedback and for you to share the results with your network.

Finally, we express our gratitude to all participants who took the time to complete the survey. Your input is invaluable and we hope you find the results as interesting as we do.
