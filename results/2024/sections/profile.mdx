# Profile

The objective of this first section is to get insights into the profile and the skills of the people working in Software Engineering in Morocco and abroad. The majority of the people that answered the survey are men. Also, the majority of the respondents are junior developers with less than 3 years of experience and most of them are living in Morocco with plans to work abroad in the next 2 years.

## Gender

Although the presence of women in the IT sectors is slightly increasing each year, the field is still highly dominated by men.

## Age

The majority of respondents is aged between 18 and 34 years old, indicating a huge workforce of junior to mid-level individuals and thus perhaps a higher demand for entry level and intermediate level jobs.

## Location

Half the activity in the IT sector in Morocco is concentrated in the two big metropols: Casablanca-Settat in the first place and Rabat-Sal√©-Kenitra coming right after. Job opportunities are definitely more present there. 
Abroad presence is also to be taken into account, although in a smaller proportion of respondents.
