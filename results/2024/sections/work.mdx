# Work

Many places and sectors in the world are facing economincal challenges, and the IT industry is no exception to that.
In Morocco however, developers are still a highly demanded asset, and most freshly-graduated easily find opportunities shortly after graduation, if not before.

Although we can notice a "Back to office" trend in big companies, which tends to persuade smaller companies into adopting similar decisions, remote work continues to be very popular among Moroccan developers, be it full-time remote or hybrid.

## Employment status

A reasonable portion of respondents are still students or looking for work, while most of them are already employed, either in companies via part-time, full-time or internship contracts, freelancers, or are engaging in entrepreneurial activities.

## Working overtime

Over 24% of participants work 1-2 days of overtime per week. Is this driven by passion, dedication, or underestimated schedules?

## Job satisfaction

Almost the same as last year with a 3% increase. Around 80% of respondents reported they are somehow happy with their current job. This is consistent with Stack Overflow's own data on developers feeling happy with their jobs.

## Choosing a job offer

Almost similar to last year, salary, technical stack, and remote work options are the top three motivators for Moroccan developers to consider a job offer. Unsurprisingly, remote work options rank third, ahead of company culture. Data shows that industry and work impact have the least weight in career decisions.

## Preferred Company size

Most respondents tend to prefer smaller-sized companies. These companies naturally favour flexbility and are less rigid in processes compared to bigger ones. Smaller companies are perhaps also much less impacted by tech debt and legacy code.

## Agile software development methodology

More than 84% of respondents are using an agile software methodology and more than 64% of them are using scrum.
