# 4. Work

Even though we hear about layoffs in the IT industry worldwide, the Moroccan IT industry is still growing. The demand for developers is increasing, and most developers have the chance to find a job right after their graduation.

Around 80% of Moroccan developers prefer working remotely, either full-time or part-time, and companies are starting to provide more options for remote work to their employees. Approximately 21% of all participants say they are students. Around 80% of respondents reported that they are somewhat happy with their current job.

### Employment status

More than 60% of all respondents are employed, either full-time, part-time, or as freelancers. Almost 8% of respondents are looking for a job opportunity.

### Working overtime

Over 24% of participants work 1-2 days of overtime per week. Is this driven by passion, dedication, or underestimated schedules?

### Job satisfaction

Almost the same as last year with a 3% increase. Around 80% of respondents reported they are somehow happy with their current job. This is consistent with Stack Overflow's own data on developers feeling happy with their jobs.

### Choosing a job offer

Almost similar to last year, salary, technical stack, and remote work options are the top three motivators for Moroccan developers to consider a job offer. Unsurprisingly, remote work options rank third, ahead of company culture. Data shows that industry and work impact have the least weight in career decisions.
