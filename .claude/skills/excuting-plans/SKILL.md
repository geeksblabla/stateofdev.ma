# Executing Plans

## Overview

Load plan, review critically, execute tasks in batches, report for review between batches.

**Core principle:** Batch execution with checkpoints for architect review.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the executing-plans skill to implement this plan."

## The Process

### Step 1: Load and Review Plan

1. Read plan file
2. Review critically - identify any questions or concerns about the plan
3. If concerns: Raise them with your human partner before starting
4. If no concerns: Create TodoWrite and proceed

### Step 2: Execute Batch

**Default: First 3 tasks**

For each task:

1. Mark as in_progress
2. Follow each step exactly (plan has bite-sized steps)
3. Run verifications as specified
4. Mark as completed

### Step 3: Report

When batch complete:

- Show what was implemented
- Show verification output
- Say: "Ready for feedback or commit changes?" or "Ready for next batch?"

### Step 4: Continue

Based on feedback:

- Apply changes if needed
- Execute next batch
- Repeat until complete

**If user wants to commit changes:**

- Run linting and type checking
- Commit changes
- Ask user if they want to execute the next batch

### Step 5: Complete Development

After all tasks complete and verified:

- Run linting and type checking
- Ask user if they want to create a pull request

## When to Stop and Ask for Help

**STOP executing immediately when:**

- Hit a blocker mid-batch (missing dependency, test fails, instruction unclear)
- Plan has critical gaps preventing starting
- You don't understand an instruction
- Verification fails repeatedly

**Ask for clarification rather than guessing.**

## When to Revisit Earlier Steps

**Return to Review (Step 1) when:**

- Partner updates the plan based on your feedback
- Fundamental approach needs rethinking

**Don't force through blockers** - stop and ask.

## Remember

- Review plan critically first
- Follow plan steps exactly
- Don't skip verifications
- Reference skills when plan says to
- Between batches: just report and wait
- Stop when blocked, don't guess
