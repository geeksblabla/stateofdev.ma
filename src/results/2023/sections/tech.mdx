### Deployment environment

In software deployment, an environment, or tier is a computer system or set of systems in which a computer program or software component is deployed and executed. That's why most of the developers use public cloud providers, like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform to deploy their applications, and other ones use on-premise servers.
