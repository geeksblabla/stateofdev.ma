# 6.Community

Open-source culture and sharing knowledge are gaining a lot of popularity in Morocco lately(<a target='_blank' href='https://www.htxt.co.za/2019/11/11/african-countries-are-the-fastest-growing-github-contributors/#:~:text=Morocco%20places%20first%20at%2065%20percent%20more%20contributors%20this%20year%20than%20last'>African countries are the fastest growing GitHub contributors</a>). More than 80% of respondents have at least contributed to an open-source project. Also, around 75% are sharing their findings and learning through blogging.

### Local Developer Communities

We don't know if people misunderstood this question or that it's actually what the reality is! But more than 70% claim that they're not part of any developer communities. Which is odd, because the majority of respondents claimed they are part of the Dev Circle Morocco community ¯\_(ツ)\_/¯.
