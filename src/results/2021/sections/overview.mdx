# 1.Overview

The annual survey on Software Developers in Morocco provides invaluable data on a community and their professional paths. Being the second year is even more interesting as we can draw trends from last year results. Following are a few selected takeaways:

- Developer landscape is constantly in motion, and pandemic or not, coders are a restless crowd. They want to learn next-gen languages: Kotlin, Rust and Typescript
- Popular languages and platforms still hold steady: Javascript, Java, Python and PHP.
- Dedication and passion is strong, to a point that many confess to weekly overtime, maybe at the expense of mental health.
- New data on employability reveals job are easier to find in 2021 than 2020
- New data on location shows Morocco is a coder nation, with half in the two biggest cities and another half in the rest of the Kingdom

### Sidenotes

Finally, we noticed this year a dip in contributions, and we learned that launching during a virtual conf like [BlaBlaConf](https://www.blablaconf.com) is definitely an audience boost. We hope it was only a road bump and next year will thrive even more.

⚠️ Since all data is open, we encourage everyone to dive into the interactive playground. We would be glad to hear about some new findings!

### A word about methodology

As part of our core principles, all collected data is anonymized. Raw results are also available under the BY-NC-SA 2.0 license. Same thing for the website code, we put everything on [GeeksBlaBla GitHub organization](https://github.com/geeksblabla/stateofdev.ma).

It’s important to note that not all fields were mandatory, so the results and graphics may not reflect the respondents’ total number for every question.

We want to thank [all our amazing contributors and everyone](https://github.com/geeksblabla/stateofdev.ma#contributors-) who helped share the survey to get more submissions. We’re looking forward to your feedback and for you to share the results with your network.
